#### LOADING IN DATA AND PACKAGES 
```{r, include=FALSE}
library("tidyverse")
library("data.table")
library("LMest")
```

Loading data! 
```{r}
morph_df <- read_csv("/work/BA2022/morph.csv") 

length(unique(morph_df$AnonID))
```

#### Left Joining and putting in NA's for all non-responses
````{r}
age <- rep(seq(12, 36, by = 3), each = length(unique(morph_df$Item)), times = length(unique(morph_df$AnonID))) 

ID <- rep(unique(morph_df$AnonID), each = length(unique(morph_df$Item))*length(unique(age)))

item <- rep(unique(morph_df$Item), times = length(unique(morph_df$AnonID))*length(unique(age)))

d <- data.frame(AnonID = ID, Child_age = age, Item = item)

#Then left_join d with the actual data set by AnonId, Child_age and Item. Havenâ€™t
#tested it, but it should work.
morph_df_full <- left_join(d, morph_df, by = c("AnonID", "Child_age", "Item"))


##LOOKS as it should
morph_df_full %>% 
  group_by(Child_age) %>% 
  summarise("OBSERVATIONS IN EACH GROUP" = n(), 
            "NUMBER OF CHILDREN RESPONDING" = length(unique(AnonID)))


#amount of children
length(unique(morph_df_full$AnonID))
````



#### MAKING A CONTINUOUS DATAFRAME

````{r}
## making the response a mean == continuous
df_cont_morph <- morph_df_full %>% 
  group_by(AnonID, Child_age, Child_gender) %>% 
  summarize("mean_resp"=mean(as.numeric(RESP_DUMMY)))

#Avoinding annoying Duplicated  NA's
df_cont_morph <- distinct(df_cont_morph, Child_age, .keep_all = TRUE)

df_cont_morph %>% 
  group_by(Child_age) %>% 
  summarize("number of children" = length(unique(ID))) #looks good

#amount of children
length(unique(df_cont_morph$AnonID))
```

#### Remove all children that appears in less than 3 TimeGroups
````{r}
df_cont_morph3 <- df_cont_morph %>% 
  group_by(AnonID) %>% 
  filter(length(mean_resp[complete.cases(mean_resp) == TRUE]) >= 2)

##How many kids do we have in total
length(unique(df_cont_morph3$AnonID))
````

##### Make gender 1 and 0 & fixing time to be from 1-9
````{r}
### we just quicly make a 
df_cont_morph3 <- df_cont_morph3 %>%
  mutate("gender" = ifelse(Child_gender == "dreng", 1, 2))

#Fill in gender, so we have no NA's 
df_cont_morph3 <- df_cont_morph3 %>%
  group_by(AnonID) %>%
  fill(gender, .direction = "downup") %>% 
  ungroup()

#Making a time variable from 0-8
df_cont_morph3$time <-  with(df_cont_morph3, ifelse(Child_age == 12, 0 ,  ifelse(Child_age == 15, 1, ifelse(Child_age ==18 , 2, ifelse(Child_age == 21, 3, ifelse(Child_age ==24, 4, ifelse(Child_age == 27, 5, ifelse(Child_age == 30, 6, ifelse(Child_age == 33, 7, ifelse(Child_age == 36, 8, NA))))))))))

#amount of children
length(unique(df_cont_morph3$AnonID))
```

#### Indexing ID
We Index ID for the sake of the model
````{r}
### making the ID from 1 .. 
df_cont_morph3$ID <- rleid(df_cont_morph3$AnonID)

#write csv
write_csv(df_cont_morph3, "/work/BA2022/morph_continuous_data.csv")
